AlexNet

● AlexNet was developed by Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever and
Geoffrey Hinton from the University of Toronto in 2012 and was the
ILSVRX winner in 2012.

● AlexNet contains 8 layers with the first five being Convolutional
Layers and the last 3 being FC layers.

● It has over 60 Million parameters and was trained on two GPUs for
over a week!


The CIFAR-10 data consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images in the official data. We have preserved the train/test split from the original dataset.

The label classes in the dataset are:

airplane 

automobile
